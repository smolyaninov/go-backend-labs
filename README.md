# go-backend-labs

A collection of backend projects in Go, built as part of the roadmap.sh learning path.

Each project is implemented in its own directory and focuses on practicing different aspects of backend development: CLI tools, HTTP services, APIs, and system design.

## Structure

Projects are grouped by difficulty level:

- `01-beginner` — fundamentals, basic tools and web apps
- `02-intermediate` — state, concurrency, caching, APIs
- `03-advanced` — system design, scalability, distributed concepts
